# Writing programs for the badge

The Fri3d Camp badge runs **MicroPythonOS**, a lightweight operating system
for microcontrollers whose applications are written in MicroPython.

With the browser-based [Fri3d-IDE](https://fri3dcamp.github.io/Fri3d-IDE/),
you can write code, manage files on the badge, run programs, export apps as
MPK files, and publish apps to BadgeHub.

!!! tip "Python experience helps, but is not required"

    MicroPython is very similar to regular Python. When you are new to
    programming, start by making small changes to an existing example.

## What is MicroPythonOS?

MicroPythonOS is an app-oriented operating system built around MicroPython.
Features such as settings, Wi-Fi, updates, and the App Store are provided as
applications.

An application can, for example:

- display text, buttons, and images;
- respond to touch input;
- read sensors and expansion boards;
- store data;
- connect to a network;
- work with other parts of MicroPythonOS.

More information:

- [MicroPythonOS documentation](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/)
- [Applications overview](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/)
- [Creating an application](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/creating-apps/)
- [Built-in applications](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/built-in-apps/)
- [MicroPythonOS App Store](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/appstore/)

## What do you need?

- a Fri3d Camp badge running MicroPythonOS;
- a USB cable that supports data transfer;
- a computer with a supported web browser;
- the [Fri3d-IDE](https://fri3dcamp.github.io/Fri3d-IDE/).

!!! warning "Not every USB cable transfers data"

    Some USB cables can only charge devices. Try another cable when the badge
    is not detected.

## Connecting the badge

1. Connect the badge to your computer over USB.
2. Open the [Fri3d-IDE](https://fri3dcamp.github.io/Fri3d-IDE/).
3. Click the button to connect a device.
4. Select the serial port belonging to the badge.
5. Allow the browser to access the device.

After connecting, you can inspect the files on the badge and run MicroPython
code.

!!! note

    Close other programs that use the same serial connection. A serial port
    can normally be opened by only one program at a time.

## Running standalone MicroPython code

For a quick test, create and run a simple Python file:

```python
print("Hello from the Fri3d badge!")
```

This is useful for:

- learning Python syntax;
- testing small pieces of code;
- experimenting with hardware and sensors;
- investigating error messages.

A standalone script does not automatically appear as an application in the
MicroPythonOS launcher.

## Creating a new application in Fri3d-IDE

Open the [Fri3d-IDE](https://fri3dcamp.github.io/Fri3d-IDE/), connect your
badge, and find **Create New App** in the app overview.

![The Create New App button in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-new-app-button-en.webp)

Click **Create New App**. Fri3d-IDE opens a form for the basic application
information.

![The Create New App form in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-new-app-dialog-en.webp)

Complete at least these fields:

- **App ID**: a unique technical name, such as `be.fri3d.lightgame`;
- **Display name**: the name shown in the launcher;
- **Version**: start with a version such as `0.1.0`;
- **Publisher**: your name, group, or organisation;
- **Description**: a short explanation of the application;
- **Template**: choose **Hello World** for a first project;
- **Icon**: upload your own icon or use the generated icon.

Click **Create**. Fri3d-IDE creates the project files and opens the new
application.

!!! tip "Use a permanent App ID"

    The App ID identifies your application on the badge and in app stores.
    Do not change it after you have shared or published the application.

## Application structure

A MicroPythonOS application normally contains a manifest, an icon, and one or
more Python files:

```text
com.example.myapp/
├── MANIFEST.JSON
├── icon_64x64.png
└── main.py
```

The directory name is the unique identifier of the application. Prefer lower
case letters and dots, for example:

```text
be.fri3d.lightgame
com.yourname.firstapp
```

Refer to the current MicroPythonOS documentation for the supported manifest
fields and application structure:

[Creating a MicroPythonOS application](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/creating-apps/)

## Testing the program

A useful development cycle is:

1. edit the code in Fri3d-IDE;
2. save the file;
3. copy or synchronise it to the badge;
4. run the program;
5. inspect the output and any errors;
6. improve the code and try again.

Work in small steps. When you make many changes at once, it becomes harder to
identify which change introduced a problem.

## Exporting the application as an MPK file

You can save a local copy of the application as an `.mpk` package. Open the
application and click the **download icon** in the app toolbar.

![The MPK export button highlighted in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-export-mpk-button-en.webp)

The highlighted button downloads the application as an MPK file to your
computer. Keep this file as a backup, share it directly with another user, or
install it later with **Install MPK** in Fri3d-IDE.

!!! tip "Keep the source files too"

    An MPK file is convenient for distribution, but your editable source
    project should also be stored on your computer or in a Git repository.

More information:

- [Bundling MicroPythonOS applications](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/bundling-apps/)
- [MicroPythonOS applications](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/)

## Publishing the application to BadgeHub

You can publish an application directly from Fri3d-IDE to
[BadgeHub](https://badgehub.eu/). You do not need to upload the MPK manually
through the BadgeHub website.

Open the application and click the cloud icon labelled
**Publish to BadgeHub**.

![The Publish to BadgeHub button in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-badgehub-publish-button-en.webp)

When you are not signed in, Fri3d-IDE asks you to log in with your BadgeHub
account.

![The BadgeHub login dialog in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-badgehub-login-en.webp)

Click **Login to BadgeHub** and complete the sign-in process. Fri3d-IDE then
opens the publishing form.

![The publishing form for BadgeHub in Fri3d-IDE](assets/uploads/fri3d-ide-badgehub-publish-form-en.webp)


Complete or verify:

- the display name;
- the version number;
- the author or publisher;
- the short and long descriptions;
- the category;
- the licence;
- the source-code URL, when available;
- whether the app should remain hidden;
- the development status.

Publish a new version only after increasing its version number.

!!! tip "Publish the first test version as hidden"

    Keep an early release hidden and mark it as under development. Test that
    it installs and starts correctly before making it public.

!!! warning "Always increase the version number"

    BadgeHub and the MicroPythonOS App Store can only recognise an update when
    the new release has a higher version number.

More information:

- [BadgeHub](https://badgehub.eu/)
- [Publishing MicroPythonOS apps to BadgeHub](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/badgehub/)
- [MicroPythonOS App Store](https://docs.MicroPythonOS.org/apps/appstore/)

## Understanding errors

When a program does not work, first check the Fri3d-IDE console.

An error message normally contains:

- the file in which the error occurred;
- the line number;
- the type of error;
- a short description.

For example:

```text
NameError: name 'message' isn't defined
```

This means that `message` is used before it has been created, or that its name
contains a typing error.

### Indentation

Python uses indentation to mark code blocks.

Incorrect:

```python
if True:
print("Hello")
```

Correct:

```python
if True:
    print("Hello")
```

### Invalid JSON

Invalid:

```json
{
  "name": "My app",
}
```

Valid:

```json
{
  "name": "My app"
}
```

### Limited memory

Microcontrollers have less memory than an ordinary computer. Large images,
long lists, and many open screens can cause problems.

Try:

- using smaller images;
- removing unused objects;
- loading files only when needed;
- restarting the badge;
- testing the program in smaller parts.

## Good practices

### Keep a copy on your computer

The badge should not contain the only copy of your project. Keep the source
code locally or in a Git repository.

### Use version numbers

For example:

```text
1.0.0
1.1.0
1.1.1
```

A common format is:

```text
major-version.new-features.bug-fixes
```

### Test without a network

An application should respond clearly when Wi-Fi or an internet service is
unavailable.

### Account for limited hardware

Avoid unnecessary background work and long blocking loops.

### Show useful errors

Display an understandable message when something fails. A console error alone
is often not enough for ordinary users.
